# Luke's dmenu

Extra stuff added to vanilla dmenu:

- reads Xresources (adds pywal compatibility)
- `-P` for password mode: hide user imput
- `-r` to reject non-matching input
- `-i` for case insensitive mode (enabled by default)

## Installation

After making any config changes that you want, but `make`, `sudo make install` it.
